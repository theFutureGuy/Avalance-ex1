# Avalanche-ex1
## Ex:1 using Revert(), Assert(), and Require() in Solidity
To use this contract, follow these steps:

Deploy the Calculator contract to an Eth Network.
Call the add(), multiply(), or divide() functions with appropriate input parameters to perform the desired operation.
Retrieve the result variable to obtain the calculated result of the operation.
### Note: The require(), assert(), and revert() statements ensure input validation and handle potential errors or internal inconsistencies during the calculations.
